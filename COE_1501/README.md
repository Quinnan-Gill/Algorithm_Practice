# COE 1501

These are the five projects I had to do for COE 1501 Implementing Algorithms. The three projects include:

* **Project 1:** Autocompletion using a DBL tree to search provide top search results the user has used in the past.

* **Project 2:** LZW compression. There are tree methods for LZW compression that relate to the bit width of the compression. The bit width grows.

* **Project 3:** A car database that uses a min heap constructed of min heaps. I really enjoyed this one because I thought the method I came up with was pretty cool.

* **Project 4:** This is a router network simulation. This project is used to represent the different types of graph algorithms.

* **Project 5:** RSA encryption (do not use for production), this was the most rewarding one, because it was a lot of toil but it worked and a implementing something like this is very fun.
